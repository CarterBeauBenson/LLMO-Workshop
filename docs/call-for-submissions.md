We are looking for papers that sit at the intersection of Large Language Models and Ontology. 
Examples of topics to consider are:
1. LLM Contributions to Ontology Development: Investigating how LLMs can assist in the creation, expansion, and refinement of ontologies.
2. Semantic Understanding in LLMs: Evaluating the ability of LLMs to understand and interpret ontological concepts and relationships.
3. Integration of Ontologies in LLM Training: Studying the impact of incorporating structured ontological knowledge into the training of large language models.
4. LLM Performance in Domain-Specific Ontologies: Assessing the effectiveness of LLMs in navigating and utilizing ontologies specific to certain fields or industries.
5. Ontology-Driven Dialogue Systems: Exploring the development of dialogue systems that leverage ontological knowledge for more coherent and contextually appropriate interactions.
